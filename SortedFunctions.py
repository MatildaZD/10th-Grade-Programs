#Sorted list
#Implement the following operations as efficiently as possible
#assuming that the input is a list sorted least-to-greatest

#Takes a (not necessarily sorted) list and
# returns a sorted list with the same elements
def create(List):
	pass

#If the target is present in the sorted list, return its index.
#Otherwise, return False.
def search(sortedList, target):
	pass

#returns the greatest item in the sorted list.
def findMax(sortedList):
	pass

#returns the minimum item in the sorted list
def findMin(sortedList):
	pass

#returns the median of the sorted list.
def findMedian(sortedList):
	pass

#takes a sorted list and modifies the list by adding item
# list must still be sorted after adding the item
def insert(sortedList, item):
	pass

#takes a sorted list and modifies the list by removing the 
# target item. If the target item is not present, does nothing
